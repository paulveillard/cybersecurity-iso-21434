## What is ISO 21434? 
Like ISO 26262 and other aspects of international standards around automotive industry development, ISO 21434 works to protect vehicle and automotive security.

It covers every single stage of the vehicle life cycle from design, secure engineering, and product development to decommissioning. Cybersecurity engineering applies to connected vehicles, electronic systems, software, and more. In addition, the automotive security standard gives developers a thorough road map for incorporating safety measures in development processes across the supply chain.

- The purpose of the standard is to define a structural process to ensure cybersecurity is “designed-in” from the start. This allows developers to address cyber threats to the vehicle and its electrical and electronic components.

> OEMs, Tier 1, and Tier 2 suppliers must demonstrate due diligence in handling vehicle development in preventing cyberattacks. The goal is to reduce the potential for a successful attack and minimize potential losses by designing security-in from the start.
